- Changed FreeU defaults to match recommended SD1.5 defaults
- Changed default denoise strength from 1.0 to 0.7
### Fixed
- Fixed ControlNet / T2IAdapter shared folder links for Automatic1111 conflicting with each other
- Fixed URIScheme registration errors on Linux

- Fixed incorrect Fooocus VRAM launch arguments

## v2.7.1
### Added
- Added Turkish UI language option, thanks to Progesor for the translation
### Fixed
- Fixed Inference Image to Image projects missing denoise strength setting

## v2.7.0
### Added
#### General
- New package: [RuinedFooocus](https://github.com/runew0lf/RuinedFooocus)
- Added an X button to all search fields to instantly clear them (Esc key also works)
- Added System Information section to Settings
#### Inference
- Added Image to Image project type
- Added Modular custom steps
  - Use the plus button to add new steps (Hires Fix, Upscaler, and Save Image are currently available), and the edit button to enable removing or dragging steps to reorder them. This enables multi-pass Hires Fix, mixing different upscalers, and saving intermediate images at any point in the pipeline.
- Added Sampler addons
  - Addons usually affect guidance like ControlNet, T2I, FreeU, and other addons to come. They apply to the individual sampler, so you can mix and match different ControlNets for Base and Hires Fix, or use the current output from a previous sampler as ControlNet guidance image for HighRes passes.
- Added SD Turbo Scheduler
- Added display names for new samplers ("Heun++ 2", "DDPM", "LCM")
- Added Ctrl+Enter as a shortcut for the Generate Image button
#### Accounts Settings Subpage
- Lykos Account sign-up and login - currently for Patreon OAuth connections but GitHub requests caching and settings sync are planned
- Supporters can now connect your Patreon accounts, then head to the Updates page to choose to receive auto-updates from the Dev or Preview channels
- CivitAI Account login with API key - enables downloading models from the Browser page that require CivitAI logins, more integrations like liking and commenting are also planned
#### Updates Settings Subpage
- Toggle auto-update notifications and manually check for updates
- Choose between Stable, Preview, and Dev update channels
#### Inference Settings Subpage
- Moved Inference settings to subpage
- Updated with more localized labels
#### Outputs Page

- Added the ability to type in a specific page number in the CivitAI Model Browser
- Right clicking anywhere on the model card will open the same menu as the three-dots button
- New model downloads will save trigger words in metadata, if available
- Model author username and avatar display, with clickable link to their profile

### Fixed
- Fixed Outputs page reverting back to Shared Output Folder every time the page is reloaded
- Potentially fixed updates sometimes clearing settings or launching in the wrong directory
- Improved startup time and window load time after exiting dialogs
